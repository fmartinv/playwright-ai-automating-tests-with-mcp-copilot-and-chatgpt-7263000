# User Story

As a BuggyBoard user,
I want to open and edit a bug from the board,
So that I can view all its data and update it for review and analysis.

# Design

- The user can open a bug by clicking the bug's row in the board table on the board page.
- Opening a bug shows a modal that is similar in design to the modal for creating a bug.
- The modal title is **"Edit bug #&lt;id&gt;"** with the bug's ID number interpolated (e.g. "Edit bug #1").
- This modal shows the bug's ID as read-only.
- All other fields are editable.
- The severity field uses the same control as the create-bug modal (dropdown with HIGH, MID, LOW). The **selected severity in the dropdown must be displayed with the same color coding as on the board**: the dropdown’s text (and optionally a light background tint) must use the same severity colors (HIGH = strong terracotta, MID = amber, LOW = muted sage) via the CSS custom properties in specs/features/08-board-severity.md, so that the modal and board look consistent.
- The bottom of the modal has buttons for "save" and "cancel".
  - The "save" button should save any modifications to the bug to the database and close the modal.
  - The "cancel" button should close the modal and _not_ save changes to the bug to the database.
- The modal has an **X** in the upper right corner; clicking it has the same effect as the cancel button (close without saving).
- Pressing the **Escape** key while the modal is open has the same effect as the cancel button (close without saving).
- Clicking the dimmed area outside the modal (the backdrop) does **not** close the modal, so the user does not lose edits by accident.
- The save button is disabled if there are no changes to the data.
- The save button is disabled if any of the fields are changed to be blank.

# Out of Scope

- Conflict detection when the same bug is edited by more than one user (last write wins).
