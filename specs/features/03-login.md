# User Story

As a BuggyBoard user,
I want to log into the app with my user credentials,
So that I can manage bugs as myself.

# Design

- The BuggyBoard app has a typical login page at `/login`:
  - It displays the BuggyBoard logo at the top of the login card, above the app title. The logo uses the same asset as the title bar (`frontend/public/logo_50x50.png`), is centered, and appears in a rounded box with a border that matches the username and password fields.
  - It has a username field.
  - It has a password field.
  - It has a login button.
- Only users listed in the `users.json` file are valid login credentials.
- When the user logs in, the app goes to the board page at `/board`.
  - For now, it can display an empty page that just says "Welcome!".
