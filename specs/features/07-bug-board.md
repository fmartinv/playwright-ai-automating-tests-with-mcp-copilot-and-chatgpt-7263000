# User Story

As a BuggyBoard user,
I want to view all bugs that my team has opened,
So that I can see all issues at one glance and then start to review bugs individually.

# Design

The `/board` page should display a table of all bugs.
The table should display the following information for each bug from left to right:

- ID
- Severity
- Title
- Owner

# Out of Scope

- Opening bug tickets from the board.
- Filtering bugs.
- Sorting bugs.

# Acceptance Criteria

Scenario: Board page displays a bugs table with the correct columns
Given the user is authenticated into the app
When the user is on the board page
Then the board page displays a table of bugs
And the table has a column for ID
And the table has a column for Severity
And the table has a column for Title
And the table has a column for Owner
And the columns are ordered from left to right: ID, Severity, Title, Owner

Scenario: Board page shows all bugs from the database
Given the user is authenticated into the app
And there are bugs in the database
When the user is on the board page
Then the table displays one row per bug
And each row shows that bug's ID, severity, title, and owner

Scenario: Board page shows an empty table when there are no bugs
Given the user is authenticated into the app
And there are no bugs in the database
When the user is on the board page
Then the board page displays the bugs table
And the table has no data rows

Scenario: Severity is displayed in all caps on the board
Given the user is authenticated into the app
And there is at least one bug in the database with severity "high"
When the user is on the board page
Then the table displays that bug's severity as "HIGH"
