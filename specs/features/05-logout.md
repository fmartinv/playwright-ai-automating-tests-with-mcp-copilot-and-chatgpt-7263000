# User Story

As a BuggyBoard user,
I want to log out of the app when I am authenticated,
So that I can close my session and prevent other users from using my credentials.

# Design

- The title bar (see [04-title-bar.md](04-title-bar.md)) has the logout button.

# Acceptance Criteria

Scenario: Authenticated user logs out of the app
Given the user is authenticated
And the board page is displayed
When the user clicks the logout button on the board page title bar
Then the user is logged out of the app and no longer authenticated
And the app redirects to the login page

Scenario: User cannot access protected content after logging out
Given the user was authenticated and has logged out
When the user navigates to the board page
Then the app redirects the user to the login page

Scenario: Browser back button after logout does not restore session
Given the user was authenticated and has logged out
And the user is on the login page
When the user uses the browser back button
Then the app does not restore the previous session
And the user remains not authenticated

Scenario: Logged-out user landing on protected page is redirected to login
Given the user has logged out
When the user lands on a protected page (e.g. via the browser back button)
Then the app redirects the user to the login page
